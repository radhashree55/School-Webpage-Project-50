    <h2>Academic excellence and intellectual sophistication offer unsurpassed preparation for global citizenship. BDIS prepare children for a life of leadership, service, respect for others, creativity, personal fulfillment and a sense of responsibility for one’s own actions. As we stand at the threshold of new era in a fast paced society, the role of education is not just limited to striving for excellence and providing an environment, to bring out student’s innate talent but also has to be meaningful and relevant. It has to provide young leaders with the necessary knowledge of how to face the challenging scenario. The future of our nation is being shaped in school and our classrooms. BDIS will arrest the exodus of students from this region to other parts of the country for quality education and create the leaders of tomorrow who will be global citizens ready to face the challenges of the future. Well rounded development of the children is the prime purpose of the school.
        The sense of dedication and educational excellence that this school has displayed in all these years is commendable and we are sure it will continue the good work in future as well.
        We provide our learners passionate and enthusiastic teachers, caring and supporting house parents, a learning environment, strong value system, tech savvy learning environment and concern for others.
        We invite parents to join us in providing a holistic education to their wards. We promise an enriching and an enjoyable journey.</h2>
